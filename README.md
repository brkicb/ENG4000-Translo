ENG 4000 Capstone project. The project involved developing an application that would allow deaf individuals to receive translation. The application achieved this by having a system that would connect deaf user to human translators through video communication. The application was developed using React Native, and used firebase for authentication, data storage, and cloud functions which were used to automatically connect deaf users to an available translator. Twilio API was used for establishing the video connection.
